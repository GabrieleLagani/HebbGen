# HebbGen

End-to-end Hebbian training of generative models with encoding-decoding branches.

Usage:  
`python demo.py --device <device>`  
where `<device>` can be `cpu`, `cuda:0`, etc.

This script creates a simple Hebbian CNN and launches a training session
using the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
